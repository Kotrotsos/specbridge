Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK)
The IIBA's BABOK Guide is the de facto standard. It structures requirements into:

Business requirements — why the organization needs change
Stakeholder requirements — what stakeholders need to achieve their goals
Solution requirements — functional and non-functional capabilities
Transition requirements — what's needed to move from current to future state

BABOK emphasizes elicitation techniques (interviews, workshops, observation, prototyping) and provides a full taxonomy of requirement types with traceability matrices.
IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148
The formal standard for Software Requirements Specifications (SRS). It prescribes a rigid structure: purpose, scope, definitions, system perspective, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, interface requirements, and constraints. Big consultancies use this when they need contractually defensible specifications, particularly in government or regulated industries.
Volere Requirements Specification Template
Developed by the Robertsons at the Atlantic Systems Guild. Popular with consultancies because it includes "fit criteria" — measurable acceptance tests for each requirement. It forces you to define how you'll know a requirement is satisfied, which prevents the ambiguity that kills projects.
Use Case Modeling (Jacobson/RUP)
Ivar Jacobson's approach, formalized in the Rational Unified Process. You model actors, use cases, and system boundaries. Each use case gets a detailed specification with preconditions, postconditions, main success scenario, and extensions. IBM Global Services and Accenture have historically leaned on this heavily.
User Story Mapping (Patton) + INVEST Criteria
For agile contexts, Jeff Patton's story mapping combined with the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) provides structure while maintaining flexibility. McKinsey Digital and Thoughtworks use variations of this.
Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE)
Academic but increasingly adopted — frameworks like KAOS and i* model requirements as goals that decompose into sub-goals, with obstacles and resolution strategies. Useful for complex systems where you need to trace from strategic objectives down to implementation requirements.
Business Motivation Model (BMM)
OMG standard that links vision, goals, objectives, strategies, tactics, and business rules. Consultancies use this to connect high-level strategy to specific requirements, ensuring alignment.

What the big firms actually do in practice: They typically combine BABOK's elicitation and categorization approach with either IEEE 29148 structure (for waterfall/contract work) or structured user stories with acceptance criteria (for agile). The key differentiator is rigorous traceability — every requirement traces back to a business objective and forward to test cases.
