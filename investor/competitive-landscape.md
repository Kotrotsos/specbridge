# SpecBridge Competitive Landscape

## Executive Summary

The requirements management market is dominated by legacy enterprise tools (IBM DOORS, Jama) and horizontal collaboration platforms (Atlassian). None are purpose-built for AI-powered knowledge extraction from domain experts. SpecBridge enters a market with no direct AI-native competitor.

## Market Gap Analysis

### What Exists Today

1. **Document-centric tools** (Confluence, Google Docs)
   - General-purpose, no structure for requirements
   - No AI assistance for knowledge extraction

2. **Traditional requirements tools** (DOORS, Jama, Polarion)
   - Complex, enterprise-focused
   - Manual input, limited AI
   - Expensive

3. **Project management tools** (Jira, Asana)
   - Track tickets, not specifications
   - No domain expertise capture

4. **AI coding assistants** (Copilot, Cursor)
   - Help write code, not requirements
   - Assume specs already exist

### What's Missing

**No tool today:**
- Conducts intelligent AI interviews with domain experts
- Automatically extracts tacit knowledge
- Generates structured specs from conversations
- Discovers edge cases systematically
- Bridges expert language to developer specs

**SpecBridge fills this gap.**

- Interview engine built from ground up for knowledge extraction
- Continuous improvement via conversation data

### 2. Domain Expertise Network Effects
- More interviews = better prompts
- Industry-specific knowledge accumulates
- Switching costs increase over time

### 3. Integration Ecosystem
- Deep integration with developer tools
- Specs flow directly to Jira, GitHub, Linear
- Becomes embedded in workflow

### 4. Speed to Market
- Enterprise competitors slow to innovate
- IBM/Jama measured in years, not months
- First-mover advantage in AI-native category
