Organizations let you group users with Roles and Permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add Organizations, create and switch Organizations, and protect routes by Organization and Roles.

<Steps>
  ## Add `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to your app

  The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage Organizations. It's recommended to place it in your app's header or navigation so it's always accessible to your users. For example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', fold: [[11, 28]] }}
    import type { Metadata } from 'next'
    import {
      ClerkProvider,
      SignInButton,
      SignUpButton,
      SignedIn,
      SignedOut,
      UserButton,
  +   OrganizationSwitcher,
    } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
    import './globals.css'

    const geistSans = Geist({
      variable: '--font-geist-sans',
      subsets: ['latin'],
    })

    const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
      variable: '--font-geist-mono',
      subsets: ['latin'],
    })

    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
      description: 'Generated by create next app',
    }

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode
    }>) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
              <header className="flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16">
  +             <OrganizationSwitcher />
                <SignedOut>
                  <SignInButton />
                  <SignUpButton>
                    <button className="bg-[#6c47ff] text-white rounded-full font-medium text-sm sm:text-base h-10 sm:h-12 px-4 sm:px-5 cursor-pointer">
                      Sign Up
                    </button>
                  </SignUpButton>
                </SignedOut>
                <SignedIn>
                  <UserButton />
                </SignedIn>
              </header>
              {children}
            </body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
  ```

  ## Access Organization data

  <Tabs items={['Server-side', 'Client-side']}>
    <Tab>
      To access information about the currently <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Active Organization</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>A user can be a member of multiple Organizations, but only one can be active at a time. The **Active Organization** determines which Organization-specific data the user can access and which Role and related Permissions they have within the Organization.</TooltipContent></Tooltip> on the server-side, use [`clerkClient()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/overview#clerk-client) to call the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>getOrganization()</SDKLink> method, which returns the Backend <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>Organization</SDKLink> object. You'll need to pass an `orgId`, which you can access from the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>Auth</SDKLink> object.

      ```tsx
      import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Page() {
        // Use `auth()` to access the `Auth` object
        // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object
        const { isAuthenticated, orgId, orgRole } = await auth()

        // Check if user is authenticated
        if (!isAuthenticated) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

        // Check if there is an Active Organization
        if (!orgId) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

        // Initialize the JS Backend SDK
        // This varies depending on the SDK you're using
        // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart
        const client = await clerkClient()

        // Use the `getOrganization()` method to get the Backend `Organization` object
        const organization = await client.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })

        return (
          <div class="p-8">
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
              Welcome to the <strong>{organization.name}</strong> organization
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-6">
              Your role in this organization: <strong>{orgRole}</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      Use the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/hooks/use-organization" sdks={["chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start"]} code={true}>useOrganization()</SDKLink> hook to access information about the currently <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Active Organization</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>A user can be a member of multiple Organizations, but only one can be active at a time.

Use the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/hooks/use-organization-list" sdks={["chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start"]} code={true}>useOrganizationList()</SDKLink> hook to access information about the current user's organization memberships.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
      'use client'

      import { useOrganization, useOrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Page() {
        const { organization } = useOrganization()
        const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
          userMemberships: true,
        })

        return (
          <div className="p-8">
            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
              Welcome to the <strong>{organization?.name}</strong> organization
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Your role in this organization:{' '}
              <strong>
                {/* Find the organization membership that matches the
                  currently active organization and return the role */}
                {
                  userMemberships?.data?.find(
                    (membership) => membership.organization.id === organization?.id,
                  )?.role
                }
              </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your app

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app locally at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

  ### Enable Organizations

  When prompted, select **Enable Organizations**. Choose to make membership required.

  ### Create first user and Organization

  You must sign in to use Organizations. When prompted, select **Sign in to continue**. Then, authenticate to create your first user.

  Since you chose to make membership required when you enabled Organizations, every user must be in at least one Organization. <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Clerk will prompt you</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>This happens because the `choose-organization` session task must be completed before the user's authentication process can be considered complete. Session tasks are pending requirements that users must complete after authentication. Learn more about [session tasks](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks).</TooltipContent></Tooltip> to create an Organization for your user.

  ## Create and switch Organizations

  At this point, Clerk should have redirected you to a page with the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> component. This component allows you to create, switch between, and manage organizations.

  1. Select the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.
  2. Enter `Acme Corp` as the Organization name.
  3. Invite users to your Organization and select their Role.

  ## Protect routes by Organization and Roles

  You can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>authorization checks</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Authorization checks are checks you perform in your code to determine the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions or access certain content. Learn more about [authorization checks](/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks).</TooltipContent></Tooltip>.

  In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` Role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` Organization.

  <Tabs items={['Server-side', 'Client-side']}>
    <Tab>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/protected/page.tsx' }}
      import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Page() {
        const { isAuthenticated, orgId, has } = await auth()

        // Check if the user is authenticated
        if (!isAuthenticated) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

        // Check if there is an Active Organization
        if (!orgId) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

        // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
        if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>

        // Initialize the JS Backend SDK
        // This varies depending on the SDK you're using
        // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart
        const client = await clerkClient()

        // Use the `getOrganization()` method to get the Backend `Organization` object
        const organization = await client.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })

        // Check if Organization name matches (e.g. 'Acme Corp')
        if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName)
          return (
            <p>
              This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
              to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
            </p>
          )

        return (
          <p>
            You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
            <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
          </p>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/protected/page.tsx' }}
      'use client'
      import { OrganizationSwitcher, useAuth, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Page() {
        // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`
        const { isSignedIn, has } = useAuth()
        const { organization } = useOrganization()
        const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

        // Check if the user is authenticated
        if (!isSignedIn) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

        // Check if there is an Active Organization
        if (!organization) return <p>Set an active organization to access this page.</p>

        // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
        if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>

        // Check if Organization name matches (e.g. 'Acme Corp')
        if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName)
          return (
            <p>
              This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
              to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
            </p>
          )

        return (
          <p>
            You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
            <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
          </p>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Navigate to [`localhost:3000/protected`](localhost:3000/protected). You should see a green message confirming you are an admin in `Acme Corp`. Use the `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to switch Organizations or rename the Organization to show the red message.

  Learn more about protecting routes and checking Organization Roles in the [authorization guide](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions).

  ## It's time to build your B2B SaaS!

  You've added Clerk Organizations to your app 🎉.

  To make configuration changes to your Clerk development instance, claim the Clerk keys that were generated for you by selecting **Claim your application** in the bottom right of your app. This will associate the application with your Clerk account.

  Here are some next steps you can take to scale your app:

  * **Control access** with [Custom Roles and Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions): define granular Permissions for different user types within Organizations.

  * **Onboard entire companies** with [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains): automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g. `@company.com`) to join Organizations without manual invitations.

  * **Enable Enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso): let customers authenticate through their identity provider (e.g. Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
</Steps>

Global Organization settings control how Organizations work across your entire application. These settings determine who can create Organizations, how members join them, what Roles they receive, and which Features are available. You'll configure most of these when you first enable Organizations, though you can adjust them later as your needs evolve.

## Enable Organizations

Organizations are disabled by default. When you enable Organizations, Clerk offers two membership requirement options:

* **Membership required (default)**: Every user is required to belong to an Organization. All new and existing users will be prompted to create or join an Organization through the [session tasks flow](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks) before they can access your application. This setting is common for most B2B SaaS.

  > \[!IMPORTANT]
  > This is the default setting since on August 22, 2025. Applications created before this date will not see the **Membership required** setting, because organization membership was optional.

* **Membership optional**: Users can operate in their own individual workspace or join Organizations. They start in their [Personal Account](#personal-accounts) and can switch to Organizations using the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> component. This setting is common for B2C applications moving to B2B.

For most B2B and multi-tenant applications, requiring organization membership is recommended to ensure proper data isolation and team structure from the start. Making membership optional is only recommended if the application serves both individual users and teams (such as tools that work for solo users but also provide team features).

To enable Organizations:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
2. Select **Enable Organizations**.
3. In the modal, choose between **Membership required** or **Membership optional** based on your decision above.
4. Select **Enable**.

Clerk measures Organizations by Monthly Active Organizations (MAOs). Refer to the [overview page](/docs/guides/organizations/overview#how-do-organizations-work) for pricing details and limits.

## Organization settings

Once Organizations are enabled, you can configure core features and behaviors, such as membership limits, Verified Domains, Organization slugs, and whether to allow Personal Accounts alongside Organizations.

### Membership limits

There is no limit to the number of Organizations a user can be a member of.

Each Organization allows a maximum of 5 members by default. You can increase this limit as your customer base grows, or set different limits for individual Organizations if you have different pricing tiers.

To change the membership limit for all Organizations in your application:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
2. In the **Default membership limit** section, update the membership limit.
   * **Free plan**: Allows a maximum of 5 members in an Organization
   * **Pro plan**: Allows unlimited members in an Organization

To change the membership limit for a specific Organization:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations).
2. Select the Organization you want to update.
3. In the **Membership limit** section, update the limit for that specific Organization.

### Personal Accounts

When enabling the Organizations feature, you were prompted to choose whether to make membership required (the default) or optional. If you chose to make membership optional, this enabled the Personal Accounts feature.

Personal Accounts are individual workspaces that allow users to operate independently without belonging to an Organization. When Personal Accounts are enabled, users start in their Personal Account by default and can switch between their Personal Account and any Organizations they belong to.

**When to enable Personal Accounts:**

Enable Personal Accounts if your application serves both individual users and teams. For example:

* A tool that works for solo users but also offers team collaboration features (like GitHub, where users can create repositories under their Personal Account or an Organization)
* Applications where users might want to work independently before joining or creating a team

**When to disable Personal Accounts:**

Most B2B and multi-tenant applications should leave Personal Accounts disabled. This ensures:

* Proper data isolation from the start.
* Clear team structure requirements.
* All users are part of an Organization, which is essential for proper access control and billing.

**Changing this setting:**

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
2. Choose **Membership optional**.

### Verified Domains

Verified Domains allow automatic or suggested Organization membership for users with specific email domains (like `@acme.com`). This is useful for company-wide rollouts where you want to streamline enrollment for employees with company email addresses. Members with the [`org:sys_domains:manage` System Permission](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions) can manage Verified Domains and enrollment modes.

Learn more about [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains).

### Organization slugs

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Organization slugs are disabled by default for applications created after October 7, 2025. For applications created before this date, you can opt to disable it.

Organization slugs are human-readable URL identifiers (like `acme-corp`) that help users reference which Organization they're working in. Enable this feature if you need Organization-specific URLs or if users frequently switch between multiple Organizations.

You can also [use Organization slugs in your application's URLs](/docs/guides/organizations/org-slugs-in-urls).

### Allow user-created Organizations

By default, users can create Organizations in your application. You can restrict this if you prefer to manually provision Organizations.

You can also override this Permission for specific users in their profile page under **User permissions**.

Learn more about [creating Organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/create-and-manage).

#### Organization creation limit

{/* TODO: Come back to this. Is the max 100, or is it unlimited? By default, in the Clerk Dash, it says unlimited. But I thought Clerk caps each user to create up to 100 orgs per application instance */}

When user-created Organizations are enabled, each user can create up to 100 Organizations by default. You can configure this to set a lower limit or allow unlimited Organizations.

To change the default limit:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
2. In the **Organization limit** section, choose between:
   * **Users can create unlimited organizations**
   * **Users can create a limited number of organizations** (specify the limit)

If you need users to create more than 100 Organizations, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }} to have the limit raised.

To override this limit for a specific user:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/users).
2. Select the user you want to update.
3. In the **User permissions** section, configure their Organization creation limit.

### Default roles

When users create or join Organizations, they need to be assigned a role. These settings determine which roles are automatically assigned in different scenarios, whether someone is creating a new Organization or joining an existing one.

#### Default role for members

The default role for members is assigned to users when they join an Organization through invitations or Verified Domain enrollment. By default, this is set to [**Member**](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#default-roles).

This role is used:

* When sending invitations from the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-profile" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationProfile /></SDKLink> component (pre-filled as default)
* When users auto-join via [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains)
* As the suggested role for new Organization members

To change the default role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles) page.
2. Select the three dots next to the role you want to set as default.
3. Choose **Set as Default role**.

Learn more about [Roles and Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions).

#### Creator's initial role

When a user creates a new Organization, Clerk automatically adds them as its first member and assigns them the Organization's designated **Creator** Role. By default, that Role is [**Admin**](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#default-roles), giving them full control over the Organization they created.

The Creator role must have at least these [System Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions):

* Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
* Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
* Delete Organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)

Learn more about the [Creator Role and how to reassign it](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#the-creator-role).

### Allow new members to delete Organizations

This setting controls whether Organization members can delete Organizations.

By default, any member with the [`org:sys_profile:delete` System Permission](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions) can delete an Organization. You can disable this if you want to prevent accidental data loss or require your own approval process before Organizations are removed.

To change this setting:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
2. Toggle **Allow new members to delete organizations**.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> This setting only applies to newly created Organizations. Existing Organizations retain their current deletion settings.

## Next steps

Now that you've configured global settings, you can:

* [Create your first Organization](/docs/guides/organizations/create-and-manage) and start adding members
* [Add members to your Organization](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/invitations) with invitations, Verified Domains, or SSO
* [Configure access control](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions) with Custom Roles and Permissions

Organizations can be created and managed either **in the Clerk Dashboard** or **in your application**. This guide covers working with individual Organizations. For global settings that affect all Organizations in your application (like enabling Organizations, setting default Roles, or configuring memberships), refer to the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/organizations/configure).

## Create an Organization

Organizations can be created in the Clerk Dashboard or in your application. The number of Organizations you can create depends on your [Monthly Active Organization (MAO) limits](/docs/guides/organizations/overview#how-do-organizations-work).

### Create an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard

To create an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) page and select the **Create Organization** button.

### Create an Organization in your application

By default, [users have permission to create Organizations within your application](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#allow-user-created-organizations). When a user creates an Organization, they become the Organization's [admin](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#default-roles) with full control over settings, members, and Permissions.

**Default limits**: Each user can create up to 100 Organizations. To change creation permissions or limits, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#allow-user-created-organizations).

The easiest way to allow users to create Organizations is to use the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/create-organization" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<CreateOrganization /></SDKLink> and/or <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> components. The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component is more comprehensive, as it handles all Organization flows including creating, switching, and managing an Organization.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build [custom flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) using the Clerk API.

## Manage Organizations

As an application owner, you can manage all Organizations in your application, both those created by you and those created by your users. You can view, update, and delete any Organization, as well as manage its members and settings.

### Manage Organizations in the Clerk Dashboard

To manage an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) page. Select a specific Organization to view its details, members, invitations, subscriptions, payments, and settings.

### Manage Organizations in your application

For managing Organizations in your application, Clerk provides prebuilt components that handle Organization management flows:

* <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-profile" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationProfile /></SDKLink> - A profile page for the user's currently active Organization where they can update settings and manage members.
* <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> - A dropdown menu that handles all Organization flows, including switching between Organizations and managing the active Organization's profile.
* <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-list" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationList /></SDKLink> - A list of Organizations that a user is a member of, with options to switch between them.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build [custom flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) using the Clerk API.

## Switch between Organizations

Users who belong to multiple Organizations can switch between them at any time. The currently selected Organization is called the active Organization.

The <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> component provides the easiest way for users to switch between Organizations. If you need more control over the switching logic, you can use the `setActive()` method from the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/hooks/use-organization-list" sdks={["chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start"]} code={true}>useOrganizationList()</SDKLink> hook, or access it directly from the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>Clerk</SDKLink> object.

If <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Personal Accounts are enabled</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>**Personal Accounts** are individual workspaces that allow users to operate independently without belonging to an Organization. Learn more about [Personal Accounts](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#personal-accounts).</TooltipContent></Tooltip>, users can switch to their Personal Account using the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component.

## Next steps

Organization invitations let you add new members to your Organization. When you send an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link. When the user visits the Organization invitation link, Clerk redirects them to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview#sign-in). If the user is already signed in, Clerk redirects them to your application's homepage (`/`). If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can [specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation](#redirect-url).

By default, only [admins](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#default-roles) can invite users to an Organization.

This feature requires that [**Email** is enabled](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#email), as Clerk uses the user's email address to send the invitation. You can still disable **Email** as a sign-in option if you do not want users to be able to sign-in with their email address.

To configure your application's **Email** settings, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

## When to use invitations

Invitations work well when you need precise control over who joins your Organization and which Role they receive. This approach fits scenarios where:

* Teams are small and members are known in advance.
* Onboarding requires manual approval or review.
* Specific Roles need to be assigned during the invitation.

If you want to streamline enrollment for users with company email addresses, consider [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains), which can automatically invite users based on their email domain. If customers require centralized authentication through their Identity Provider, use [Enterprise SSO](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso).

## Create an invitation

Clerk's <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/overview" sdks={["react","nextjs","js-frontend","chrome-extension","expo","expressjs","fastify","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","go","astro","nuxt","vue","ruby","js-backend"]}>prebuilt components</SDKLink> and [Account Portal pages](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview) manage all Organization invitation flows, including creating, managing, and accepting invitations.

However, if you want to build custom flows, see the following sections.

### Client-side

To create an Organization invitation on the client-side, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/manage-organization-invitations). Note that this uses the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization#invite-member" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>organizations.inviteMember()</SDKLink> method, which does not let you specify a redirect URL; it will always redirect to the Account Portal sign-in page. If you want to specify a redirect URL, you must create the invitation on the server-side.

### Server-side

To create Organization invitations on the server-side, use the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-invitations/post/organizations/\{organization_id}/invitations){{ target: '_blank' }} either by using a cURL command or the <SDKLink href="/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart" sdks={["js-backend"]}>JS Backend SDK</SDKLink>. The JS Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API.

Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "JS Backend SDK"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to create an Organization invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      * Your <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Secret Key</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Your Clerk **Secret Key** is used to authenticate requests from your backend to Clerk's API. You can find it on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable.**</TooltipContent></Tooltip> is already injected into the code snippet.
      * Replace the `org_123` with the ID of the Organization you want to invite the user to.
      * Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user.
      * Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite.
      * Replace the `role` with the role you want to assign to the invited user.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      * Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Secret Key</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Your Clerk **Secret Key** is used to authenticate requests from your backend to Clerk's API. You can find it on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable.**</TooltipContent></Tooltip>.
      * Replace the `org_123` with the ID of the Organization you want to invite the user to.
      * Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user.
      * Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite.
      * Replace the `role` with the Role you want to assign to the invited user.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "email@example.com", "role": "org:member" }'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    To use the JS Backend SDK to create an invitation, see the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/organization/create-organization-invitation" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>createOrganizationInvitation()</SDKLink> reference documentation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For an example of the response, see the [Backend API reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-invitations/post/organizations/\{organization_id}/invitations){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### Redirect URL

When you create an invitation, you can specify a `redirect_url` parameter. This parameter tells Clerk where to redirect the user when they visit the invitation link.

The following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with the `redirect_url` set to `https://www.example.com/accept-invitation`.

```bash
curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "email@example.com", "role": "org:member", "redirect_url": "https://www.example.com/accept-invitation" }'
```

Once the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the page you specified. On that page, you must handle the authentication flow in your code. You can either embed the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/authentication/sign-in" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<SignIn /></SDKLink> component or, if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your needs or you require more control over the logic, you can build a [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/accept-organization-invitations).

> \[!TIP]
>
> To test redirect URLs in your development environment, pass your port. For example, `http://localhost:3000/accept-invitation`.

### Invitation metadata

You can also add metadata to an invitation when creating the invitation through the Backend API. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, Clerk stores the **invitation** metadata (`OrganizationInvitation.publicMetadata`) in the Organization **membership's** metadata (`OrganizationMembership.publicMetadata`). For more details on Organization membership metadata, see the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/types/organization-membership" sdks={["js-frontend"]}>OrganizationMembership</SDKLink> reference.

To add metadata to an invitation, add the `public_metadata` parameter when creating the invitation.

The following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with metadata.

```bash
curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "email@example.com", "role": "org:member", "public_metadata": {"department": "marketing"} }'
```

## Revoke an invitation

Revoking an invitation prevents the user from using the invitation link that was sent to them.

### Client-side

To revoke an invitation client-side, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/manage-organization-invitations).

### Server-side

To revoke an invitation server-side, use the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-invitations/post/organizations/\{organization_id}/invitations/\{invitation_id}/revoke){{ target: '_blank' }}. either by using a cURL command or the <SDKLink href="/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart" sdks={["js-backend"]}>JS Backend SDK</SDKLink>. The JS Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API.

Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

Organization metadata lets you store custom information about an Organization that is not part of the standard fields, such as custom attributes that are specific to your application. This is useful for advanced user segmentation, analytics, or storing application-specific data like subscription tier, department, or region.

Metadata is stored on the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>Organization</SDKLink> and <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/types/organization-membership" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>OrganizationMembership</SDKLink> objects.

## Types of metadata

There are two types of Organization metadata: **public** and **private**.

| Metadata | Frontend API | Backend API |
| - | - | - |
| Public | Read access | Read & write access |
| Private | No read or write access | Read & write access |

Both the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>Organization</SDKLink> and <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/types/organization-membership" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>OrganizationMembership</SDKLink> objects have the metadata fields: `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`.

* Use the `publicMetadata` property if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.
* Use the `privateMetadata` property if the custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.

## Set Organization metadata

You can set Organization metadata in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) or using Clerk's Backend API. See the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-metadata" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>updateOrganizationMetadata()</SDKLink> and <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-membership-metadata" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata()</SDKLink> methods for more information.

## Access public metadata

To access public metadata on the frontend, it's available on the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>Organization</SDKLink> object, which can be accessed using the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/hooks/use-organization" sdks={["chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start"]} code={true}>useOrganization()</SDKLink> hook.

To access public metadata on the backend, it's available on the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization" sdks={["js-backend"]}>Backend `Organization`</SDKLink> object which can be accessed using the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>getOrganization()</SDKLink> method. This method will return the `Organization` object which contains the public metadata. However, this method is subject to [rate limits](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits#backend-api-requests), so *if you are accessing the metadata frequently*, it's recommended to [attach it to the user's session token](#metadata-in-the-session-token).

## Metadata in the session token

Retrieving metadata from the `Organization` or `OrganizationMembership` objects on the server-side requires making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to [rate limits](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits#backend-api-requests). You can store it in the user's session token, which doesn't require making an API request as it's available on the user's authentication context. **However, there is a size limitation to keep in mind.** Clerk stores the session token in a cookie, and most browsers cap cookie size at [**4KB**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109#section-6.3). After accounting for the size of Clerk's default claims, the cookie can support **up to 1.2KB** of custom claims. **Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly.**

If you need to store more than 1.2KB of metadata, you should [store the extra data in your own database](/docs/guides/development/webhooks/syncing#storing-extra-user-data) instead. If this isn't an option, you can [move particularly large claims out of the token](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens#example) and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend, but this approach brings back the issue of making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to rate limits.

Another limitation of storing metadata in the session token is that when you modify metadata server-side, the changes won't appear in the session token until the next refresh. To avoid race conditions, either [force a JWT refresh](/docs/guides/sessions/force-token-refresh) after metadata changes or handle the delay in your application logic.

If you've considered the limitations, and you still want to store metadata in the session token:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page.
2. Under **Customize session token**, in the **Claims** editor, you can add any claim to your session token that you need and select **Save**. To avoid exceeding the session token's 1.2KB limit, it's not recommended to add the entire `organization.public_metadata` or `organization_membership.public_metadata` object. Instead, add individual fields as claims, like `organization.public_metadata.birthday`. When doing this, it's recommended to leave particularly large claims out of the token to avoid exceeding the session token's size limit. See the [example](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens#example) for more information.

Organization slugs are human-readable URL identifiers (like `acme-corp` or `marketing-team`) that help users reference which Organization they're working in. A common pattern for Organization-scoped areas in an application is to include the Organization slug in the URL path, making links sharable and providing clear context about which tenant the page belongs to.

For example, a B2B application named "Petstore" has two customer Organizations: **Acmecorp** and **Widgetco**. Each Organization uses its name as a slug in the URL:

* **Acmecorp**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`acmecorp`**`/dashboard`
* **Widgetco**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`widgetco`**`/dashboard`

Alternatively, <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization#properties" sdks={["js-frontend"]}>Organization IDs</SDKLink> can be used to identify Organizations in URLs:

* **Acmecorp**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8e`**`/dashboard`
* **Widgetco**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8f`**`/dashboard`

### When to use Organization slugs

This feature is intended for apps that **require** Organization slugs in URLs. **We don't recommend adding slugs to URLs unless necessary.**

Use Organization slugs if:

* Users frequently share links for public-facing content (e.g., documentation, marketing materials, and third-party blogs).
* Users regularly switch between multiple Organizations.
* Organization-specific URLs provide meaningful context.

**Don't** use Organization slugs if:

* Most users belong to only one Organization.
* You want to keep URLs simple and consistent.
* You're primarily using the Clerk session for Organization context.

This guide shows you how to add Organization slugs to your app's URLs, configure Clerk components to handle slug-based navigation, and access Organization data based on the URL slug at runtime.

<Steps>
  ## Configure `<OrganizationSwitcher />` and `<OrganizationList />`

  The <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationSwitcher /></SDKLink> and <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-list" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationList /></SDKLink> components provide a robust set of options to manage Organization slugs and IDs in your application's URLs.

  Set the following properties to configure the components to handle slug-based navigation:

  * Set `hideSlug` to `false` to allow users to customize the Organization's URL slug when creating an Organization.
  * Set `afterCreateOrganizationUrl` to `/orgs/:slug` to navigate the user to the Organization's slug after creating an Organization.
  * Set `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` to `/orgs/:slug` to navigate the user to the Organization's slug after selecting it.

  For example, if the Organization has the slug `acmecorp`, when a user creates or selects that Organization using either component, they'll be redirected to `/orgs/acmecorp`.

  ## Configure `clerkMiddleware()` to set the Active Organization

  > \[!TIP]
  > If your app doesn't use `clerkMiddleware()`, or you prefer to manually set the <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger>Active Organization</TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>A user can be a member of multiple Organizations, but only one can be active at a time. The **Active Organization** determines which Organization-specific data the user can access and which Role and related Permissions they have within the Organization.</TooltipContent></Tooltip>, use the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/clerk" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>setActive()</SDKLink> method to control the Active Organization on the client-side.

  With <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware" sdks={["nextjs"]} code={true}>clerkMiddleware()</SDKLink>, you can use the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware#organization-sync-options" sdks={["nextjs"]} code={true}>organizationSyncOptions</SDKLink> property to declare URL patterns that determine whether a specific Organization should be activated.

  If the middleware detects one of these patterns in the URL and finds that a different Organization is active in the session, it'll attempt to set the specified Organization as the active one.

  In the following example, two `organizationPatterns` are defined: one for the root (e.g., `/orgs/acmecorp`) and one as the wildcard matcher `(.*)` to match `/orgs/acmecorp/any/other/resource`. This configuration ensures that the path `/orgs/:slug` with any optional trailing path segments will set the Organization indicated by the slug as the active one.

  > \[!WARNING]
  > If no Organization with the specified slug exists, or if the user isn't a member of the Organization, then `clerkMiddleware()` **won't** modify the Active Organization. Instead, it will leave the previously Active Organization unchanged on the Clerk session.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts', mark: [[7, 13]] }}
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export default clerkMiddleware(
    (auth, req) => {
      // Add your middleware checks
    },
    {
      organizationSyncOptions: {
        organizationPatterns: [
          '/orgs/:slug', // Match the org slug
          '/orgs/:slug/(.*)', // Wildcard match for optional trailing path segments
        ],
      },
    },
  )

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ### Handle failed activation

  Now that `clerkMiddleware()` is configured to activate Organizations, you can build an Organization-specific page while handling cases where the Organization can't be activated.

  Failed activation occurs if no Organization with the specified slug exists, or if the given user isn't a member of the Organization. When this happens, the middleware won't change the Active Organization, leaving the previously active one unchanged.

  For troubleshooting, Clerk will also log a message on the server:

  > Clerk: Organization activation handshake loop detected. This is likely due to an invalid Organization ID or slug. Skipping Organization activation.

  It's ultimately the responsibility of the page to ensure that it renders the appropriate content for a given URL, and to handle the case where the expected Organization **isn't** active.

  In the following example, the Organization slug is detected as a Next.js [Dynamic Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) param and passed as a parameter to the page. If the slug doesn't match the Active Organization slug, an error message is rendered and the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/components/organization/organization-list" sdks={["astro","chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","nuxt","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start","vue","js-frontend"]} code={true}>\<OrganizationList /></SDKLink> component allows the user to select a valid Organization.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
    const { orgSlug } = await auth()
    const { slug } = await params

    // Check if the org slug from the URL params doesn't match
    // the active org slug from the user's session.
    // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid Organizations.
    if (slug != orgSlug) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Sorry, Organization {slug} is not valid.</p>
          <OrganizationList
            hideSlug={false}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
          />
        </>
      )
    }

    return <div>Welcome to Organization {orgSlug}</div>
  }
  ```

  ## Render Organization-specific content

  Use the following tabs to learn how to access Organization information on the server-side and client-side.

  <Tabs items={["Server-side","Client-side"]}>
    <Tab>
      To get Organization information on the server-side, access the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>Auth</SDKLink> object which includes the active org's `orgId` and `orgSlug` and the current user's `orgRole` and `orgPermissions`. To access *additional* Organization information server-side, like the Organization name, you can store the additional information in the user's session token. To [customize the session token](/docs/guides/sessions/customize-session-tokens), do the following:

      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page.
      2. Under **Customize session token**, in the **Claims** editor, add any claim you need to your session token. For this guide, add the following claim:

         ```json
         {
           "org_name": "{{org.name}}"
         }
         ```
      3. Select **Save**.

      Now that you've added the claim to the session token, you can access it from the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object" sdks={["js-backend"]} code={true}>sessionClaims</SDKLink> property on the `Auth` object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx', mark: [[24, 25]] }}
      import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        const { orgSlug, sessionClaims } = await auth()
        const { slug } = await params

        // Check if the org slug from the URL params doesn't match
        // the active org slug from the user's session.
        // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid Organizations.
        if (slug != orgSlug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, Organization {slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hideSlug={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
              />
            </>
          )
        }

        // Access the org name from the session claims
        let orgId = sessionClaims['org_id'] as string

        return <div>{orgId && `Welcome to organization ${orgId}`}</div>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      To get Organization information on the client-side, use the <SDKLink href="/docs/:sdk:/reference/hooks/use-organization" sdks={["chrome-extension","expo","nextjs","react","react-router","remix","tanstack-react-start"]} code={true}>useOrganization()</SDKLink> hook to access the <SDKLink href="/docs/reference/javascript/organization" sdks={["js-frontend"]} code={true}>organization</SDKLink> object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx', mark: [[27, 28]] }}
      'use client'

      import { OrganizationList, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        // Use `useOrganization()` to access the currently active org's `Organization` object
        const { organization } = useOrganization()

        // Check if the org slug from the URL params doesn't match
        // the active org slug from the user's session.
        // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid Organizations.
        if (!organization || organization.slug != params.slug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, Organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hidePersonal={false}
                hideSlug={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
              />
            </>
          )
        }

        // Access the org name from the `Organization` object
        return <div>{organization && `Welcome to Organization ${organization.name}`}</div>
      }
      ```
