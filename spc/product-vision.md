# Product Vision

## Core Value Proposition

BridgeSpec acts as a **two-stage knowledge bridge**:

1. **Capture phase**: Interviews domain experts using their language, extracting process logic, business rules, and edge cases
2. **Translation phase**: Presents that knowledge to technical implementers with diagrams, formalized logic, and clarifying explanations

## The Problem

When you need to automate a business process, you sit in meetings with domain experts trying to capture complex rules. You take notes, maybe draw some diagrams, ask clarifying questions. But:

- Experts struggle to articulate edge cases they handle instinctively
- You're translating in real-time between business language and technical logic
- Crucial details emerge weeks later during implementation ("Oh, I forgot to mention...")
- Documentation becomes stale the moment the meeting ends

**The gap**: Domain experts and implementers speak different languages, work at different paces, and think in different structures.

## The Solution

A **dual-interface knowledge capture system**:

**For the expert**: A conversational tool that asks smart questions in business terminology, probes for edge cases, accepts examples, and lets them refine their answers over time as they remember nuances.

**For the implementer**: That same knowledge presented as flowcharts, decision trees, formalized rules, test cases, and a queryable knowledge base, with gaps and ambiguities clearly highlighted.

## Value Proposition

### Time Savings
- No more repeated clarification meetings
- Async knowledge capture fits into expert schedules
- Self-service Q&A reduces back-and-forth

### Quality Improvements
- Systematic probing catches edge cases early
- Visual diagrams reveal logical inconsistencies
- Knowledge persists beyond individual meetings

### Risk Reduction
- Complete audit trail of business rules
- Easy validation with domain experts ("Is this diagram correct?")
- Documentation that evolves with understanding

## Differentiation

### This isn't:
- Just another documentation tool (it actively interviews and structures knowledge)
- A process mining tool (it captures intention, not just observed behavior)
- A requirements management system (it translates domains, not just tracks features)

### This is:
- An intelligent intermediary that speaks both languages fluently
- A knowledge extraction system optimized for the business-to-technical handoff
- A tool that makes tacit knowledge explicit and actionable

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | BridgeSpec Differentiation |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Scribe | "Scribe documents what users do. BridgeSpec extracts why they do it." |
| Confluence | "Confluence stores knowledge. BridgeSpec captures it." |
| Business Analysts | "BridgeSpec gives you 24/7 access to structured knowledge extraction." |

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
- **Pricing rules**: "When do we apply which discount?"
- **Approval workflows**: "Who approves what, when, and with which exceptions?"
- **Calculation logic**: "How do we compute the adjusted value given all these factors?"
- **Data validation**: "What makes a submission valid or invalid?"
- **State transitions**: "What triggers moving from status A to status B?"

### Example Scenario
Converting numbers to different ranges based on conditional rules. This is perfect because:
- It sounds simple but hides complexity
- Experts know it intuitively but struggle to explain it
- Small errors have big downstream impacts
- It's a pattern that appears everywhere (pricing, scoring, categorization)

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Forward deployment engineers and technical consultants who need to extract business logic from domain experts.

**Secondary**: Domain experts who want to document their processes without needing to learn technical notation.

## Audience-Specific Pitches

**To enterprises**:
"You're spending 30-40% of implementation time just understanding requirements. We capture that knowledge once, structured, and it becomes a reusable asset for every technical person who touches that process."

**To domain experts**:
"No more sitting through technical meetings trying to translate your expertise into flowcharts. Answer questions in your own language, at your own pace, and the tool handles the translation."

**To developers/implementers**:
"It's like having a business analyst who actually asked all the right questions and documented everything in a format you can immediately use."

**To investors/partners**:
"We're building the missing layer between business domain knowledge and technical implementation, a massive gap that currently costs enterprises millions in rework, miscommunication, and failed projects."
